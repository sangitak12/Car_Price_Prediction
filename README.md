# Car_Price_Prediction

In this project, we used the Spark distributed data processing framework to predict the selling price of new cars based on various predictors. By integrating MongoDB with Spark, we efficiently managed and analyzed the data. However, the initial model's performance was modest, with an R2 score of 0.45. To improve the model, we conducted further investigations such as residual analysis and feature importance assessment. We also suggested exploring alternative regression algorithms, feature engineering techniques, regularization methods, and employing cross-validation. Despite its limitations, this project has the potential to assist car sellers, buyers, and dealerships in estimating car selling prices and making better decisions in the automotive market
